The idea for this challendge is to find the right hash and break it. Although normal hashes would take a very very long time to break even with strong computing power, luckily this one was already an entry in the many online databases.

The hash we need to locate is this:
flag{33C5D4954DA881814420F3BA39772644}

And if we put it through an online database, we get the following as our flag:
33C5D4954DA881814420F3BA39772644 = crackme
flag{crackme}
