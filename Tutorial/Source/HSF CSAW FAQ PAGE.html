<h3>Why does HSF exist as a competition?</h3>
<p>HSF exists for many reasons. For students who are already interested 
in cyber security and hacking, it provides a fun opportunity to hone 
skills and gain experience. For students with no prior 
interest/experience in cyber security and digital forensics, HSF helps 
increase awareness of educational opportunities and career paths in this
 dynamic field. 

Additional benefits include:
</p><ul> 
<li>Scholarships, prizes, travel awards</li>
<li>Pre-college experience</li>
<li>Experience of participating in an international competition with thousands of students from around the world</li>
<li>Opportunity to meet industry experts and learn about internships</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>Does HSF condone hacking? </h3>
<p>We encourage legally exploring computer systems and learning how 
computers and systems work. We do not condone hacking in the illegal 
sense, which is how you usually hear it in the news: breaking into 
machines illegally, stealing personal information, and launching denial 
of service attacks.
</p>

<h3>Who is eligible to play HSF?</h3>
<h4>Qualification Round - September 22 - October 2, 2017</h4>
<p>Everyone is welcome to play in the Qualification Round of HSF, 
September 22 - October 2, 2017. Players from around the world and with 
different life experiences will participate in HSF -- not just high 
school students.  
</p>

<p>Teams/players may play as much or as little as they want through the 
Qualification Round. For high school students, we recommend dedicating 
as much time as you have to working through the Challenges, while 
maintaining your normal school and extracurricular schedule.  
</p>

<h4>Final Competition - November 9 - 11, 2017</h4>
<p>The Final Competition is open to high school students from three 
different global regions. Eligibility rules vary by region, as follows: 
</p>

<h4>France: </h4>
<p>Teams must consist of 1 to 3 students, all of whom must be enrolled 
in the same high school in the Grenoble Academy. Teams must be formed 
during the Qualification Round. Each team may compete under only one 
team name, and a mentor needs to be identified for the team.
</p>

<h4>United Arab Emirates: </h4>
Teams must consist of 1 to 3 students, all of whom must be enrolled in 
the same high school in the United Arab Emirates. Teams must be formed 
during the Qualification Round. Each team may compete under only one 
team name, and a mentor needs to be identified for the team.

<h4>United States: </h4>
<p>Teams must consist of 1 to 3 students, all of whom must be enrolled 
in the same high school in the United States. Teams must be formed 
during the Qualification Round. Each team may compete under only one 
team name, and a mentor needs to be identified for the team. 
</p>

<h3>Who qualifies to be a “mentor” of a team and what is their role?</h3>
<p>Each team is required to identify a mentor, who must be a teacher or a
 parent/guardian approved by the team’s high school. The mentor will 
assist the team in preparing to compete in both the Qualification and 
Final competitions. Additionally, the mentor will serve as the chaperone
 for teams who qualify for and travel to the Final Competition. Mentors 
should not assist students in solving challenges during the 
Qualification Round and Final Competition. 
</p>

<h3>When is the deadline to register? </h3>
<p>Registration officially closes on October 2, 2017 when the Qualification Round of HSF ends.
</p>

<h3>Do I need to know coding, hacking, or computer security to be able to play HSF? </h3>
<p>No! No prior experience is needed to compete in HSF. Students with varied interests are encouraged to play. 
</p>

<h3>How can I prepare for the  competition? </h3>
<p>You can start to prep for prelims over the summer with <a href="https://cyfor.engineering.nyu.edu/">CyFor</a>, an online learning module that teaches the basics of digital forensics. 
</p>

<h3>What other opportunities are available to help my team prepare for HSF? </h3>
<p>Dates for an online webinar will be announced soon! 
</p>

<h3>How difficult is the HSF competition? </h3>
<p>We have a range of challenges, some that are very easy to solve and 
others that are very difficult to solve. If the competition isn't tough,
 it won't be fun because it won't challenge and teach you. 
</p>

<h3>What technology is needed to compete in the Qualification Round? </h3>
<p>The Qualification Round of HSF is here on the HSF platform (See 
"Challenges" above). Your team will need regular access to a computer 
and an Internet connection. We recommend that you have unfiltered 
Internet access, as well as the ability to install software.
</p>

<h3>What are the HSF Fair Play Rules? </h3>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Each team may compete under one team name only
</li><li>A team is not allowed to give themselves or another team an unfair advantage</li>
<li>Members of a given team are not allowed to share answers with any other team</li>
<li>Teams are not allowed to work together to secure multiple spots in the Final Round</li>
<li>Teams may use any freely available tool to complete a given challenge. </li>
<li>Tools that must be purchased (e.g., ordered online) are prohibited</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h3>What constitutes cheating?</h3>
<p>
</p><ul>
    <li>Attacking the scoring server, other teams, or any machines not 
designated as targets -- that includes breaking into said machines and 
denying others access to them (for example, by altering a key or 
ping-flooding)</li>
    <li>Sharing keys or giving hints to other teams </li>
    <li>Being assisted by non-team members, for example, a team’s mentor
 or friends. It's okay to use free tools and resources available on the 
Internet, but it's not okay to ask people (online or offline) to help 
you solve the problem. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h3>How do you qualify for Finals?  </h3>
<h4>France: </h4>
<p> During the Qualification Round, eligible teams win by getting the
